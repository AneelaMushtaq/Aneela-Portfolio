						Now a days, My favourite personality is IMRAN KHAN.Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi HI(M) PP (Urdu/Pashto: عمران احمد خان نیازی; born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician and former cricketer who served as the 22nd prime minister of Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022, when he was ousted through a no-confidence motion. He is the founder and chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), one of the largest political parties in the country. His sympathetic position toward the Pakistani Taliban and Afghan Taliban, as well as his criticism of the US-led war on terror, has earned him the moniker "Taliban Khan" in Pakistani politics. Imran Khan is among the most inspiring personalities of Pakistan. He has always inspired the youth of Pakistan with his sense of conviction and devotion. People of all ages idolize him and for his intellect and personality. 

He is the only Pakistani cricket team captain who brought the World Cup to Pakistan by leading the team. With the prize money he received, he opened a Cancer hospital known as “Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.” More than 75% of patients at this hospital get free Cancer treatment. 

In 1996 he joined politics leading his own campaign called “Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.” After a long and tiring journey of 22 years, he finally became the Prime Minister of Pakistan as people realized his struggle and hard work for the country. 

Imran Khan has always positively represented Pakistan worldwide and he is undoubtedly among the most respected people in the world.
